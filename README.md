## What is Trayful?

Trayful is a to-do application/task manager that aims to create a graphically pleasing *user-interface* and smooth *user-experience* while still maintaining *function*. Designed with the user in mind, Trayful implements easy-to-use interfaces complete with intuitive gestures and flush animations.

Trayful was developed completely programmatically in `Swift 5.2`, which I prefer over storyboard as I find it much more controllable from an interface standpoint.

> **var** storyboard = **false**
